- Implement basic Monte Carlo algorithm
- Add configurable parameters (iterations, variance)
- Include unit tests for edge cases
- Update documentation
```

Format:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- First line: brief summary (50 chars or less)
- Blank line, then detailed description if needed
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
