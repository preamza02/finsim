FinSim is an open-source alternative to ProjectionLab, designed to help individuals plan their financial future through comprehensive simulation and modeling tools.

## üéØ Vision

FinSim aims to democratize financial planning by providing a powerful, transparent, and accessible tool for:
- Long-term financial projections
- Retirement planning
- Investment scenario modeling
- Cash flow analysis
- Goal tracking and optimization

## ‚ú® Planned Features

### Core Financial Modeling
- **Income Modeling**: Salary, bonuses, side income, and passive revenue streams
- **Expense Tracking**: Fixed and variable expenses with inflation adjustments
- **Asset Management**: Real estate, investments, retirement accounts (401k, IRA, etc.)
- **Debt Management**: Mortgages, student loans, credit cards, and other liabilities
- **Tax Calculations**: Federal and state tax estimations with deductions

### Simulation & Analysis
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Statistical modeling of various financial scenarios
- **What-if Analysis**: Compare different life decisions and their financial impact
- **Retirement Planning**: Calculate retirement readiness and withdrawal strategies
- **Goal Planning**: Set and track progress toward financial milestones
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Understand how changes in assumptions affect outcomes

### Visualization & Reporting
- **Interactive Charts**: Net worth, cash flow, asset allocation over time
- **Milestone Tracking**: Visual indicators for goal achievement
- **Custom Reports**: Export and share financial projections
- **Dashboard**: Overview of current financial health and projections

### Data & Privacy
- **Local-First**: Your data stays on your device
- **Import/Export**: Support for CSV, JSON, and common financial formats
- **Backup & Sync**: Optional encrypted cloud backup
- **Privacy-Focused**: No tracking, no ads, no data selling

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

FinSim is designed with a modern, modular architecture:
- **Frontend**: Interactive web application for data input and visualization
- **Calculation Engine**: Core financial modeling and simulation logic
- **Data Layer**: Flexible storage with support for local and cloud backends
- **API**: RESTful API for integrations and extensions

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
